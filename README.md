pyVBus
======

An attempt at implementing the RESOL VBus protocol in Python.

The RESOL VBus is a 2-wire bus system used by RESOL electronic controllers to communicate with each other.
This project is aimed at implementing a pluggable architecture allowing use of various stream decoders.
The example stream decoder covers the DeltaSol C solar controller.

This is very much work in progress, albeit a working Java implementation already exists.
